"User-Safe" Password Organizer
###############################

User-Safe is a program to save usernames and passwords for all the different online accounts
that the modern internet user has. Users are prompted to input the website, username and password,
which is then stored. Users can then look up stored information by typing in the name of the 
website, which will then generate the username and password on file.

Name: 
===============
Alex

Details:
===============
A Young professional that works full time in an office and is also an online student.
Uses computer and technology often for many different tasks, including, work, 
studies and entertainment. Currently lives abroad and does not want to accumulate
too many physical belongings and items. Sometimes unorganized and forgetful.

Problem Scenario
*********************

Problem Scenario:
==========================
As Alex relies on the computer and different internet accounts to carry out his activities.
He has many different user accounts on many different sites, each of which require different
username and password specifications. All of these different combinations are
very difficult for him to remember.

Current Alternatives:
==========================
Write down user information in notebook; keep Excel or Word document of user information;
try to remember user information and complete reset procedures when he forgets such 
information.

Value Proposition:
==========================
Create a program to store user information that corresponds to certain sites, such as 
Blackboard, Netflix, Facebook, etc. User should be able to enter information via interactive
prompt and have it automatically stored.The user can then call user information by inputting
the website name, to be displayed cleanly in a table. In order to call the user information, 
it may be beneficial to require the entry of a password and to encrypt the stored information.


************************
User Stories
************************
As Alex the young worker/student, I want to be able to store all of my user information in
one program on my computer, allowing me to input this information once and be able to
retrieve it easilly later on. I do not want to have to write anything down. I want to be able
to type in the name of the service and have it generate my saved username and password.
The service should be secure, so there should a at least a password prompt in order to receive 
the information.
